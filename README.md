# Overview

I am trying to learn as a software engineer. I want to learn more about how to manage databases, create apps, and be able to communicate with other computers, sensors and databases efficiently and securely. As I continue my studies, I want to learn more about embedded systems, as smart home technologies are very intruiging to me. 


This software is a simple Hello World project. It is simply a basis to start from.


The purpose of creating this software is to have a starting point in my journey of programming.
